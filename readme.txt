Description:

This program, Boggle, is a word-search game that is written in Python and uses Tkinter as the canvas. The two main project source files that this project requires are Boggle.py and Graphics.py. 

Graphics.py lays the foundation for all the code in Boggle.py. It sets up the canvas and the various classes required for the creation of graphics and animation in Tkinter. Through Graphics.py, Boggle.py communicates with Tkinter.  

Boggle.py contains the class BoggleEvents, which is a subclass of BoggleGraphics in Graphics.py. This is the main event-handler of the program. It is where mousePressed, keyPressed and timerFired are defined.

How to start:

In order to start the game, open the file Boggle.py and run it. A Tkinter canvas will appear, in which the game can be played.
